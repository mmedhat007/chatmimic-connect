# Backend Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the ChatMimic Connect backend.

## Secure API Architecture

### 1. Proxy Endpoints for External Services

We've implemented secure proxy endpoints to handle all external API calls, preventing direct exposure of API keys to the client:

- `/api/proxy`: Secure proxy for generic API calls to authorized services
- `/api/embeddings`: Secure generation of text embeddings using OpenAI
- `/api/extract-data`: Structured data extraction from text using Groq LLM
- `/api/match-documents`: Vector search for matching embeddings/documents

These endpoints:
- Use Firebase Authentication for user verification
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement detailed logging with PII redaction
- Provide standardized error handling

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints require a valid Firebase token
- **Auth Middleware**:
  - `requireAuth`: Enforces authentication for protected routes
  - `optionalAuth`: Supports conditional authentication for mixed-access routes
- **CSP Headers**: Comprehensive Content Security Policy restricting resource loading to trusted domains

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Express Validator**: All endpoints use robust validation middleware
- **XSS Protection**: Inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Custom Validators**: Domain-specific validators for different types of data

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Secure Token Handling

- API tokens for third-party services (OpenAI, Groq, Supabase) are stored server-side only
- Environment variables are used for all sensitive credentials
- Token verification for all authenticated requests

### 2. Error Handling & Logging

- Centralized error handling with appropriate status codes
- Detailed logging with PII redaction
- Performance monitoring (response times, request details)
- Production vs. development error detail levels

### 3. Rate Limiting & Quotas

- Per-user rate limits for API access
- Resource usage tracking for high-cost operations (embeddings generation)
- Quota enforcement for fair resource allocation

## Dependency Security

- Regular security audits of npm dependencies
- Explicit versioning in package.json
- Use of Helmet for HTTP security headers
- CORS configuration limiting access to approved origins

## Data Handling

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling in accordance with privacy policies
- User data isolation in Supabase
- Least privilege principle for database operations

## Environment Configuration

- Secure .env file management
- Different configurations for development/production
- Service-specific configuration options

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Comprehensive request logging
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring for API endpoints

## Security Testing

- Regular security audits
- Input validation testing
- Authentication bypass testing

## Future Improvements

- API throttling implementation
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Additional encryption layers for sensitive data
- OAuth scope restriction refinements
