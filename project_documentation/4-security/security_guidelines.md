# ChatMimic Connect - Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security best practices and guidelines for the ChatMimic Connect platform.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Firebase Authentication
- All user authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication
- Firebase ID tokens are used to authenticate API requests
- Token verification is performed on the server for all protected routes

### Authorization
- Role-based access control implemented for different user types
- API endpoints check user permissions before processing requests
- Row-level security implemented in database where possible

## Data Security

### Sensitive Data
- API keys and credentials are stored server-side only
- Environment variables are used for all sensitive configuration
- Personal data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is handled according to privacy policies
- User data isolation in database tables

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- XSS protection using proper encoding and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries

## API Security

### Request Validation
- All API requests are validated for proper format and content
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- CORS headers restrict access to approved domains

### Response Security
- Standardized error responses without exposing sensitive details
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented to prevent various attacks
- Proper use of HTTP security headers

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Production deployments use HTTPS only
- TLS 1.2+ required for all connections
- Firewall rules restrict unnecessary access

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging with PII redaction
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Regular security audits

## Third-Party Integrations

### WhatsApp Integration
- WhatsApp Business API access tokens stored securely
- Message content securely transmitted and stored

### Google Integrations
- OAuth 2.0 used for Google service authentication
- Limited scopes requested for Google API access
- Refresh tokens securely stored

### AI Provider Integration (OpenAI, Groq)
- API keys stored server-side only
- Content filtered before sending to external AI services
- AI responses validated before relaying to users

## Security Testing

- Regular automated security testing
- Input validation testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Vulnerability scanning
